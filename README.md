Astrangia poculata heat stress response

This repository contains data from an experiment testing the influence of heat treatment and symbiosis on intracellular pH homeostasis, growth, and host histology in the temperate coral Astrangia poculata. It also contains code to reproduce all analysis of these data, including statistical tests and graphs, described in the manuscript "The temperate coral Astrangia poculata maintains acid-base homeostasis through heat stress" authored by Luella Allen-Waller, Benjamin H. Glass, Katelyn G. Jones, Anna G. Dworetzky, and Katie L. Barott.
