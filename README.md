# Astrangia.Heat.pHi
Astrangia poculata heat stress response

This repository contains data from an experiment testing the influence of heat treatment and symbiosis on intracellular pH homeostasis, growth, and host histology in the temperate coral Astrangia poculata. The file "ApocTempData.csv" contains temperature data from HOBO loggers throughout experimental manipulations. The file "ApocDailyObservations.csv" contains color and extension data from observations over the course of the experiment. "ApocHeatStress.csv" contains all data on A. poculata physiology, histology, and cell pH after temperature treatments. "ApocRawBuoyantWeights.csv" contains all raw buoyant weight measurements of ramets from the experiment. "ApocStdAllMeasurements.csv" contains all fluorescence ratios from the Astrangia intracellular pH standard generated for this study. "ApocHeatStressAnalysis.R" contains code to reproduce analysis of these data, including statistical tests and graphs, described in the manuscript "The temperate coral Astrangia poculata maintains acid-base homeostasis through heat stress."
